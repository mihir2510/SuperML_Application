### Features

- With our state-of-the-art system, you don't have to write a single piece of code to get the best model. It automates every Supervised Learning Task.
- Check out our SDK written in Python so that you can integrate our system within any Python application! <a href="https://github.com/mihir2510/AutoML_library">Here</a>
- You can customize multiple parameters in the website or the library before training the model.
- Our system beats many models fine-tuned by humans in time to train as well as the performance.
- Intuitive User Interface and instructions will make your experience butter smooth. Intuitive User Interface with each step defined clearly.
- Our Tool not only lets you train models as you want but also provides an exhaustive report of the performance of each configuration tried out. Includes Scoreboard and graphs.
- Get 2d plots for your ease of comparing performances of various configurations along with subplots with varying parameters. Charts are plotted with instrinsic colors and clear information.
- Are you the one with hunger for cool and complex things? We even provide a 3d surface plot which is totally interactive enabling you to study the effects of change on performance in-depth.
